# Sieve
## Description
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm used for discovering all primes between 0 and a specified number. While brute-forcing a solution would be O(nâˆšn), the algorithm reduces the worst-case time complexity down to simply O(n x log(log n)). This tool provides a visual companion for better understanding the logic behind the process. You can read more about the algorithm [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).
